Beginner Level Project for TOP

This project involved an attempt at replicating a pre-existing design via HTML and CSS. Basic HTML elements were used, especially div. 

The heavy lifting i.e. what made the content presentable was the styling via CSS. This 
project involved heavy usage of flex-box.

Through this project, I was able to recognize the importance of flex-box and also apply the 
skills that I've been able to acquire over the period of this course.
